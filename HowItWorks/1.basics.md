### Node jS
**Node.js** is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside of a web browser. It's built on top of Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine, with more functionalities added and some are removed too.   
Basically, Node.js is JavaScript with additional tools for backend and server-side programming.

**Key takeaways:**

* **Runs JavaScript outside the browser:** Initially JavaScript was introduced primarily to run only on web-browsers *(using JavaScript runtime environment named V8, which is available by default in all Chrome browser)*. Node.js is another runtime environment built on top of the V8, whcih extends JavaScript's capabilities to the server-side *(any where nodeJs is installed)*, enabling developers to build robust back-end applications.

**What can you build with Node.js?**

Node.js is most adaptable and used for a wide range of applications, including:

* **Websites and APIs:** Building the back-end infrastructure for websites and applications.
* **Command-line tools:** Creating utilities for automating tasks and scripting.
* **Real-time applications:** Developing chat applications, online games, and collaborative tools.
* **Etc.**

**Common differences between JavaScript (JS) in the browser and Node.js**:

| **Aspect**          | **JavaScript (Browser)**                              | **Node.js**                                        |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| **Environment**      | Runs in the browser.                                  | Runs on the server (outside the browser).         |
| **Global Object**    | `window` is the global object.                        | `global` is the global object.                   |
| **Modules**          | Uses `<script>` or ES modules (`import/export`).      | Uses CommonJS (`require`) or ES modules.         |
| **File System**      | No direct access to the file system.                  | Full access to the file system via `fs` module.  |
| **APIs**             | DOM and Web APIs like `document`, `fetch`.            | Built-in Node.js APIs like `fs`, `http`.         |
| **Event Loop**       | Focuses on handling UI events and browser tasks.      | Designed for server-side tasks and I/O operations.|
| **Purpose**          | Frontend development (interactivity, UI logic).       | Backend development (servers, databases).        |
