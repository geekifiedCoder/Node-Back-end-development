### Node jS
> ***It would be better if you understand JavaScript before starting Node.js***

we know that **JavaScript is ascripting language** used to make websites interactive. It can manipulate HTML and CSS dynamically, handle user events, and create dynamic content (e.g., animations or form validations).

While **Node.js** is a **runtime environment** that allows JavaScript to run outside the browser, such as on servers, desktops, or even embedded devices. It enables JavaScript to interact with hardware (e.g., filesystems, databases, networks) and perform server-side tasks.

  
> **In simple**  HTML and CSS are for structuring and styling a website, while JavaScript is a scripting language that adds interactivity. **Node.js** is a runtime environment for JavaScript, allowing it to work outside browsers, including on servers and devices.*

**Node.js** is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside of a web browser. It's built on top of Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine *(Javascript runtime environment for Chrome browser)*, with more functionalities added and some are removed too.   
Basically, Node.js is JavaScript runtime-environment with additional tools for backend *(any devices where node.js installed)* and server-side programming.

**Key takeaways:**

**Runs JavaScript outside the browser:** Initially JavaScript was introduced primarily to run only on web-browsers *(using JavaScript runtime environment named V8, which is available by default in all Chrome browser)*. Node.js is another runtime environment built on top of the V8, which extends JavaScript's capabilities to the server-side *(any where nodeJs is installed)*, enabling developers to build robust back-end applications.

**What can you build with Node.js?**

Node.js is most adaptable programming language and used for a wide range of applications, including:

* **Websites and APIs:** Building the back-end infrastructure for websites and applications.
* **Command-line tools:** Creating utilities for automating tasks and scripting.
* **Real-time applications:** Developing chat applications, online games, and collaborative tools.
* **Etc.**

### key differences between Js and Node.js:

#### 1. **Definition**
   - **JavaScript**: A scripting language primarily used for creating interactive and dynamic content on web pages. It runs only on the browser.
   - **Node.js**: A runtime environment that allows JavaScript to run outside of a browser, often used for server-side development.

---

#### 2. **Purpose**
   - **JavaScript**: Focused on front-end development for client-side (web-browser) tasks like DOM manipulation, handling user events, and animations.
   - **Node.js**: Designed for back-end development to create server-side applications, handle APIs, databases, and file systems.

---

#### 3. **Execution Environment**
   - **JavaScript**: Runs in web browsers (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari) using their built-in JavaScript engines.
   - **Node.js**: Runs on the V8 JavaScript engine (used by Chrome), but it executes outside the browser.

---

#### 4. **Built-in Libraries**
   - **JavaScript**: Provides browser-specific libraries like `window`, `document`, and `alert`.
   - **Node.js**: Provides server-side modules like `fs` (file system), `http` (to create servers), and `os` (operating system utilities).

---

#### 5. **Usage**
   - **JavaScript**: 
     - Manipulating web pages (e.g., updating HTML and CSS dynamically).
     - Handling browser events.
     - Making AJAX requests for dynamic data updates.
   - **Node.js**:
     - Building RESTful APIs.
     - Running scripts to automate tasks.
     - Developing server-side applications (e.g., Express.js frameworks).
     - Handling real-time data with WebSockets.

---

#### 6. **Modules**
   - **JavaScript**: Uses the ES6 module system (`import` and `export`).
   - **Node.js**: Primarily uses the CommonJS module system (`require` and `module.exports`), but also supports ES6 modules.

---

#### 7. **Event Loop**
   - **JavaScript**: The event loop is managed by the browser and is mainly used for handling asynchronous tasks in web applications.
   - **Node.js**: The event loop is crucial for handling non-blocking I/O operations on the server, making it efficient for concurrent tasks.

---

#### 8. **Global Objects**
   - **JavaScript**: Has browser-specific global objects like `window`, `document`, and `navigator`.
   - **Node.js**: Has Node-specific global objects like `global`, `process`, and `Buffer`.

---

#### 9. **File System Access**
   - **JavaScript**: Cannot directly access the file system for security reasons.
   - **Node.js**: Can access the file system using built-in modules like `fs`.

---

#### 10. **Platform**
   - **JavaScript**: Platform-dependent (runs in the browser).
   - **Node.js**: Platform-independent (can run on Windows, macOS, Linux, etc.).

---

#### 11. **Concurrency**
   - **JavaScript**: Uses asynchronous patterns (e.g., `Promise`, `async/await`) primarily for client-side operations.
   - **Node.js**: Leverages the event-driven, non-blocking architecture for highly scalable back-end systems.

---

#### 12. **Frameworks**
   - **JavaScript**: React, Angular, Vue.js (focused on UI development).
   - **Node.js**: Express.js, Koa.js, Nest.js (focused on server development).
